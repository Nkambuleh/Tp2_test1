Source Code Management Life Cycle for Collaborative Software Development

Source code management (SCM) is a crucial aspect of collaborative software development. It encompasses various stages to ensure smooth collaboration among team members and efficient management of codebase changes.

Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering
At this stage, the team outlines project objectives, identifies requirements, and plans the development process. 


stage 2: During development, team members work on implementing features or fixing bugs based on the requirements.

stage 3: After development, the code undergoes testing to ensure it meets quality standards and functions as expected.

stage 4: Once testing is complete, the code is deployed to production or staging environments.

stage 5: In the maintenance stage, the team monitors the deployed application, addresses bugs, and implements updates as necessary.

stage 6: Throughout the life cycle, documentation is essential for understanding the codebase and facilitating collaboration.
